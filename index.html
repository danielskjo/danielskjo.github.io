      <p>Hi. My name is Daniel Jo.</p>
      <p>
        I am a third-year computer science student at
        <a href="https://www.csulb.edu/" target="_blank"
          >California State University, Long Beach</a
        >. I am passionate about theoretical computer science and software
        engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I am an instructional student assistant for the algorithms
        course and an undergraduate researcher in the Data Science Lab. I am
        also the GDSC Lead for
        <a
          href="https://gdsc.community.dev/california-state-university-long-beach/"
          target="_blank"
          >Google Developer Student Club</a
        >
        and the secretary for
        <a href="https://csulb.acm.org/" target="_blank"
          >Association for Computing Machinery</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously, I was a software development engineer intern at
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon</a> on the
        Amazon Private Brands Discovery and Infrastructure Engineering Team and
        a software engineer intern at
        <a href="https://www.linquest.com/" target="_blank">LinQuest</a> on the
        MILSATCOM Systems Engineering, Integration, and Test (MSEIT) team.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of school and work, I like to play sports (volleyball,
        basketball, badminton, table tennis) and instruments (drums and guitar).
        I also like to go eat good food with friends.
